After unzipping the files, open Stata and set the current working 
directory to the main directory of the files 
(where the .do files are stored).

The analysis from the book can be completed by typing at the terminal window

do appendix.do
do chapter"X".do

where "X" = 1,...,10.

Selected parts of the analysis may be completed by opening the .do files using 
Stata's .do file edittor and highlighting commands, then pressing the "do" button 
within the edittor.

The same result may be obtained by copying the commands and pasting them into the
Stata terminal window.  This can be done using any text edittor.

The .ado files contain original programs that the book analysis uses.  The user
can learn more about these programs by typing at the terminal window

help "program name"

where "program name" is one of irp, mmp, etc.

These programs use the moremata package.

To install this package in Stata, type

"ssc install moremata"
